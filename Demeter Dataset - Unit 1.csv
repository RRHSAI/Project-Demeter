What is the control of a given experiment?,The control or control group is a seperate group within a study that is not affected by the independent variable.,The control group is affected by the independent variable.,"When we conduct an experiment, we often compare what happens when we make a change to something (called the ""independent variable"") to what happens when we don't make that change. The thing we don't change is called the ""control."" The control helps us make sure that any changes we see in the experiment are really caused by the change we made to the independent variable, and not by some other factor.",LOPEZ,,,,,,
What are constants in an experiment?,constants are variables that are kept the same or consistent throughout the entire experiment. ,constants are variables that change over time,"The purpose of keeping constants is to ensure that the only variable that changes is the one being tested (the independent variable), so that any observed effects can be attributed to the independent variable and not to other factors.",LOPEZ,,,,,,

Lighting conditions: Light can affect the growth and development of plants and animals, and can also influence the behavior of people or animals in a study. Time: Time is often an important factor in experiments, but it should be kept constant to ensure that the results are not affected by changes that occur over time. Equipment: The use of different equipment or instruments can affect the accuracy and precision of measurements, so it is important to use the same equipment throughout the experiment. Concentration of reagents or solutions: The concentration of chemicals or solutions used in an experiment can affect the outcome, so it is important to keep the concentration constant to ensure that any observed effects are due to the independent variable being tested. pH: pH will affect many chemical reactions",LOPEZ,,,,,,
Why must multiple trials occur in an experiment?,Repeating an experiment can account for the variability between results.,Repeating an experiment can cause error,"Repeating an experiment several times can help reduce the effects of random error or variability in the data. This can improve the reliability and accuracy of the results. Additionally, conducting multiple trials allows researchers to calculate the average or mean of the results, which can provide a more accurate representation of the data than a single trial. Also, by conducting multiple trials, researchers can identify and address any inconsistencies or outliers in the data, which can help to strengthen the overall conclusions drawn from the experiment.",LOPEZ,,,,,,
What are SEM bars?,"SEM bars stand for ""standard error of the mean"" bars. They are a type of graphical representation used in scientific research to show the variability of a sample mean around the true population mean.",SEM bars are not distict from standard bar charts.,"The SEM is a measure of the precision of the sample mean estimate, and it reflects how much the sample mean might vary if you took repeated samples from the same population. SEM bars are typically drawn on a bar graph or line graph to show the range of values within which the true population mean is likely to fall. In other words, SEM bars give an idea of the reliability of the sample mean as an estimate of the true population mean. If the SEM bars are small, it suggests that the sample mean is a more precise estimate of the population mean, while if the SEM bars are large, it suggests that the sample mean is a less precise estimate of the population mean. ",LOPEZ,,,,,,
What is a chi square?,Chi-square (χ²) is a statistical test that is used to analyze categorical data and determine whether there is a significant association or difference between observed and expected frequencies. It is typically used to test hypotheses about the proportions or frequencies of categories in a population.,Chi-squares are used for evaluating error from results.,"The chi-square test involves calculating the difference between observed and expected frequencies in a contingency table, and then comparing that difference to the theoretical distribution of chi-square values. The test produces a chi-square statistic and a p-value, which indicates the probability of obtaining the observed results by chance alone. In science, the p value is fixed at 0.05. In other words, the chi-square test helps us to determine whether the differences between the observed and expected values are statistically significant, or if they could be due to random chance.",LOPEZ,,,,,,
What are histograms?,"Histograms are a type of graph used to represent the distribution of numerical data. They display the frequency or count of data points that fall within specified intervals, called bins, along a horizontal axis.",Histograms are a type of data stored within bars of different categories,"Histograms display the frequency or count of data points that fall within specified intervals, called bins, along a horizontal axis. The vertical axis of the histogram shows the number of observations that fall into each bin. To create a histogram, the range of data is divided into a set of equal-sized intervals or bins. The number of observations falling into each bin is then counted and represented as a bar on the graph. The bars are typically drawn next to each other with no gaps between them, and the width of each bar corresponds to the width of the bin. Histograms are useful for visualizing the shape of a dataset, including its central tendency, spread, and any skewness or symmetry. They can also be used to identify outliers or any unusual patterns in the data.",LOPEZ,,,,,,

Since both the water and the sand recieve roughly the same amount of heat energy, the water has a cooler temperature.",LOPEZ,,,,,,
Is water polar?,Water is a polar substance,Water is not a polar substance,"Water gets its polarity because of the electronegativity difference between oxygen and hydrogen atoms. Oxygen is much more electronegative than hydrogen, which means it has a greater attraction for electrons. When an oxygen atom covalently bonds with two hydrogen atoms to form a water molecule, the oxygen atom pulls the shared electrons closer to itself, creating a partial negative charge (δ-) on the oxygen atom and a partial positive charge (δ+) on each of the hydrogen atoms. This separation of charges results in a dipole moment and makes water a polar molecule.",LOPEZ,,,,,,
